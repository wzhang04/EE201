# About Me
I'm a sophomore ECE student currently taking EE201. I took EE280 with Professor Eley last quarter and had a very good experience, so I'm looking forwards to learning with her again. I am not sure yet what my intended concentration or focus in ECE is, but I hope by taking more EE classes I can explore my options and find what I'm interested in.

Outside of class, I am involved in Husky Robotics on its electronics subsystem. I enjoy taking walks, eating good food, and going to the gym.
